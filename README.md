# Markdownly

We currently have a markdown editor that allows our customers to edit markdown
files and see a preview. The editor is becoming more popular and we have several
feature requests asking us to allow users to edit multiple markdown files at once.
Think the sheets in Google sheets or excel.

**For clarification see the Customer Success Team.**

Further, we are nearing the end of our funding runway and are about to start demoing
for some venture capitalist next week. We want this new feature to be part of that
demo, but to prevent any mishaps we are going to freeze new feature development in
48 hours. This means we need to complete this feature in the next 48 hours.

## Flow

* All code must be reviewed by a Senior Software Engineer (TAs).
* Project Managers (TAs) will add new cards to your Trello board as you progress.
* Plan out how you will accomplish each task
  * create Checklists (Part of the Trello cards)
  * ask for clarification
* Add new cards as needed (e.g. Bugs) and label them
